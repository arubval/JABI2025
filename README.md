## Biological warfare between two bacterial viruses in an archipelago of defense systems sheds light on the spread of the CRISPR-Cas system

A plethora of bacterial defense mechanisms exist to combat infection by viruses and other external motile elements. A notable example is the CRISPR-Cas system, which is an adaptive immune system found in bacteria and archaea. Recent findings have revealed that these defense systems can be co-opted by viruses to enhance their ability to infect hosts successfully or to establish an adaptive synergy with the bacteria. In this study, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the viruses that infect Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic pathogen that is a primary cause of nosocomial infections in hospital environments. Our research has identified one such virus, and further analysis revealed that this system is present in an integration hotspot of the bacterial genome, where it resides alongside numerous other defense mechanisms. The CRISPR-Cas system, being the I-Fa type mobilized by a virus known as PPTOP on some occasions, appears to be particularly targeted by another virus, called as DgiS1, that could compete with the system itself for the same integration site. It is noteworthy that both viruses possess a diverse array of defense mechanisms within its accessory genome, including Restriction-modification (RM) and RosmerTA systems, among others. Understanding of this viral warfare involving antiviral systems could be useful in the fight against infections caused by bacteria, and it would also shed light on how CRISPR-Cas systems expand in bacteria.

Fig. 1. Gene structure of the I-Fa and I-Fb CRISPR-Cas systems. Distribution of the Ka/Ks ratio in all the protein-coding genes from the pangenome, where different groups are highlighted (different colors) and genes that encode for uncharacterized proteins (asterisks). Black dots represent the median of the distribution. Note the double grouping of genes inside both +1 and −2 reading frames.
