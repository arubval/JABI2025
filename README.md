## The most exposed regions of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins are subject to under positive selection and gene overlap may locally modify this behavior

The SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic that emerged in 2019 has been an unprecedented event in international science, as it has been possible to sequence millions of genomes, tracking their evolution very closely. This has enabled various types of secondary analyses of these genomes, including the measurement of their sequence selection pressure. In this work we have been able to measure the selective pressure of all the described SARS-CoV-2 genes, even analyzed by sequence regions, and we show how this type of analysis allows us to separate the genes between those subject to positive selection (usually those that code for surface proteins or those exposed to the host immune system) and those subject to negative selection because they require greater conservation of their structure and function. We have also seen that when another gene with an overlapping reading frame appears within a gene sequence, the overlapping sequence between the two genes evolves under a stronger purifying selection than the average of the non-overlapping regions of the main gene. We propose this type of analysis as a useful tool for locating and analyzing all the genes of a viral genome, when an adequate number of sequences are available. 

The Ka/Ks ratio is used to measure the pressure selection. This is the number of non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) per synonymous substitution site (Ks). We have previously shown that this ratio can measure evolutionary pressure in bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori or Acinetobacter baumannii.

Fig. 1. Ka/Ks ratio in the pangenome of H. pylori. Distribution of the Ka/Ks ratio in all the protein-coding genes from the pangenome, where different groups are highlighted (different colors) and genes that encode for uncharacterized proteins (asterisks). Black dots represent the median of the distribution. Note the double grouping of genes inside both +1 and −2 reading frames.
